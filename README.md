## Introduction üé∂

FileTune was created as a personal project to explore web development and audio programming. The aim was to build a straightforward website for playing music files without the hassle of downloads or installations. This project incorporates various features like playlists, sharing options, and music discovery, enhancing the overall user experience.

Using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, FileTune utilizes the HTML `<audio>` element to seamlessly embed audio files in the web page. For further details on the `<audio>` element and its attributes, you can refer to the following resources:
